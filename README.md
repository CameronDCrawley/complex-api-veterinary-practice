# 🐾 Project: Complex API 1 - Veterinary Practice

### Goal: Build a simple front-end app that uses data returned from one api to make a request to another api to create something that would be beneficial to a veterinary practice.

### How to submit your code for review:

- Fork and clone this repo
- Create a new branch called answer
- Checkout answer branch
- Push to your fork
- Issue a pull request
- Your pull request description should contain the following:
  - (1 to 5 no 3) I completed the challenge
  - (1 to 5 no 3) I feel good about my code
  - Anything specific on which you want feedback!

Example:
```
I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4
I'm not sure if my constructors are setup cleanly...

# Vet Assist Dog Breed Health & Image Lookup

A web application that combines FDA veterinary adverse event reports with the Dog CEO API to fetch health incident data and a photo for a selected dog breed.

---

## Features

- **FDA Adverse Event Data:** Searches FDA veterinary reports to display reported symptoms, drug ingredients, brand names, and health outcomes for a specific breed.
- **Dynamic Breed Matching:** Formats and cleans FDA breed names to seamlessly fetch matching images from the Dog CEO API.
- **Random Breed Image:** Displays a random photo of the searched dog breed alongside its health report data.

---

## APIs Used

- **openFDA Animal & Veterinary API:** `https://api.fda.gov/animalandveterinary/event.json`
- **Dog CEO Dog API:** `https://dog.ceo/api/breed/{breed}/images/random`

---

## How It Works

1. The user inputs a dog breed into `#dogInput` and clicks the `#dogBtn` button.
2. The application queries the openFDA API for the top veterinary adverse event report linked to that breed.
3. It updates the DOM with reported symptoms (`veddra_term_name`), drug information (active ingredients and brand name), and medical outcome.
4. The breed name from the FDA response is parsed and formatted to match the Dog CEO API breed structure.
5. A secondary request fetches a random image of the breed from Dog CEO and renders it in the `#placeHere` element.
